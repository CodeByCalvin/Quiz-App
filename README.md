<h2>Project Brief</h2>

The aim of this project is to create a quiz that will ask a series of questions and produce a result on completion of all the questions.
<br>The quiz can take the form of “mostly a’s” type scoring (although this should be calculated automatically for the user rather than relying on them adding it up) or can use a more complex scoring system to calculate the result.
<br>You can use the provided personality quiz to provide the questions and result or you can be more creative and make something like this (Harry Potter sorting hat quiz).
<br>Extra bragging rights will be awarded for creativity in the subject and presentation of your quiz.

<h2>Your Project</h2>

The quiz should be created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The quiz should include the following functionality:

1. A Single HTML page. The user should not move from the page when answering the questions or getting the results.
2. A simple design that uses bootstrap elements to manage layout.
3. A separate css file should be used for styling the page.
4. The quiz should consist of at least 5 multiple choice questions.
5. The quiz should process the users responses and produce a result at the end.
6. Questions not in use should be hidden.
7. User response could be either by selecting a radio button or clicking a picture link but should not use popup boxes or text entry.
8. The result should be hidden until the end.
9. Initial information about the quiz should be displayed when the user first opens the page. This should be hidden whilst the user answers questions and when the results are displayed.
10. Functions should be reused where possible.

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
- The address for the GitHub repository. 
<br> - The address for the GitHub pages.

<h2>Extension</h2>
- Store the JavaScript functions in a separate file and abstract them so some can be reused to score and present a second set of questions on a separate HTML page.
